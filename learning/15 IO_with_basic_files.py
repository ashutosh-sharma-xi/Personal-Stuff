# File IO basics with python
"""

"""
'''
first we need to open the file by using open() function then further we use read() or 
write() function to read or add something to the file. atlast we close the file using 
close() function, we only need to use close funciton if we modify the file. while 
opening the file we need to specify that we we are opening the file, ie to specify
we use open() with

"r" open file for reading
"w" open file for writing
"x" create file if not exists 
"a" add more content to a file
"t" text mode
"b" binary mode
"+"  read and write
'''
'''
file = open('python.txt','a')
file.write('hiee this is file handling \nyou can know all about file hndling here\nstart from here')
file.close()
'''

file = open('python.txt','r') 
#fileread = file.read()
#fileread = file.read(3) # will read 3 character of the file only
#fileread = file.readline()  # read first line of the file
#fileread = file.readline(3) # read 3 character of the first line
#fileread = file.readlines() # read whole file and the lines will be given in list format and \n will also be counted
fileread = file.readlines()[2] # this will read second line from the file
print(fileread)
file.close()


#=====================================================================================
'''
tell() function - while using readline() or read() if we want to 
know that where is our cursor we use tell() function
'''
file = open('python.txt','r')
readd = file.readline() # will read first line
print(readd)
print(file.tell())
readd = file.readline()   # will read second line
print(readd)
print(file.tell())    # this will tell where now the cursor is on file


'''
seek() function:this function is used to move the cursor the particular line
       (this is very helpful when you want to print a particular line you dont need to use loop)
'''
print(file.read())
readd = file.readline() # will read first line
print('from here ', readd)
file.seek(0)        #this will again move the cursor to first line
print(file.readline())  # will again read firstline
file.seek(1)  # this will tell where now the cursor is on file
print(file.readline()[0:5])

#====================================================================


# using with block to open python files

with open('python.txt') as opn:  # we do not need to close() the file if opening via with block
    rd = opn.read()
    print(rd)
